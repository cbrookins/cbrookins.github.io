title: FreeNAS jail for cloud printing

## Use case  
I wanted to set up my old HP PhotoSmart inkjet printer with Google Cloud Print, 
but I did not want to have the client on one of my machines that I use day to day. I ended up deciding to use a jail on my FreeNAS box.  
  
## The Goods  
Starting off with a fresh FreeNAS-11.3-U3.1 jail.  
  
### Install some packages  
``pkg install cups cloudprint hplip nano``

### Prep cupsd  
``touch /etc/devfs.rules``  

edit **/etc/devfs.rules** and add  
```
[system=10]
add path 'unlpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'ulpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'lpt*' mode 0660 group cups
```  

edit **/etc/rc.conf** and add  
```
cupsd_enable="YES"
devfs_system_ruleset="system"
```  
[comment]: <> (edit **/usr/local/etc/rc.d/cloudprint** and modify)
[comment]: <> (``: ${cloudprint_enable="NO"}`` to read ``: ${cloudprint_enable="YES"}``)

Run the following commands  
``/etc/rc.d/devfs restart``  
``/usr/local/etc/rc.d/cupsd restart``  
``cupsctl --remote-admin --share-printers``  

You should now be able to get to the cups web management using **http://server_name_or_ip:631**  

Login using FreeNAS **root** login. You could also set up a new user and add it to the **cups** group.  

Add your printer under the **Administration** tab  

Now run the following command to get your Google link to register your printer with your Google account  
``cloudprint -d``  

Reboot and verify that **cloudprint** is running  

You should now be able to send jobs to the Google cloud printer and they end up in your printer tray.
