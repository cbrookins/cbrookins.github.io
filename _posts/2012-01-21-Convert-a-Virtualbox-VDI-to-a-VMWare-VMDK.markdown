title: Convert a Virtualbox VDI to a VMWare VMDK
date: 2012-01-21

I recently made the switch from a headless <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> server running <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/" target="_blank">PHPVirtualbox</a> to the free <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/overview.html" target="_blank">VMWare vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)</a>.  Switching out the <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Server 10.04</a> OS for the vSphere hypervisor was simple.  Took less than thirty minutes.  The problem came when I found out that vSphere doesnt like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDI_(file_format)#Virtual_Disk_Image" target="_blank">VDI</a> files that <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> creates by default.  I probably should have checked that first.  

I knew it couldnt be that hard to convert the files, so I started by checking out tools that were available from VMWare. First was the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/" target="_blank">VMWare vCenter Converter</a>.  It was described as "Automate and simplify physical to virtual machine conversions as well as conversions between virtual machine formats".  vCenter Converter did not recognize my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDI_(file_format)#Virtual_Disk_Image" target="_blank">VDI</a> files.  

Next I came across a lot of people saying to use <a href="http://qemu.org/" target="_blank">Qemu</a> to do the conversion.  Currently I am on a Windows 7 workstation, so this option is no good. I could use a Linux VM or boot to a live distro, but what can I do with what I already have?  

Then I found, in the last place I thought to look, in the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> documentation&#8230;<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html" target="_blank">http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html</a>.  I had used VBoxManage in the past to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDI_(file_format)#Virtual_Disk_Image" target="_blank">VDI</a> files from RAW disks, but it didnt occur to me at first to see what else it could do.  Well, it can convert from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDI_(file_format)#Virtual_Disk_Image" target="_blank">VDI</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK" target="_blank">VMDK</a> and it is VERY easy.  All you need is <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> installed.   

In a Windows command prompt &#8216;cd to the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> installation directory and run the following command.  You can also add the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> installation directory to your PATH statement if you do not want to &#8216;cd all the time.  Dont forget to change the "pathtoimage.vdi" and "pathtoimage.vmdk".  

In Linux you can run the command as is. Just copy and past, changing the "pathtoimage.vdi" and "pathtoimage.vmdk".  

VBoxManage clonehd "pathtoimage.vdi" "pathtoimage.vmdk --format VMDK  n
