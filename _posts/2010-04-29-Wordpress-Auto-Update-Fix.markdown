title: Wordpress Auto Update Fix
date: 2010-04-29

I recently ran into a problem with my Wordpress installations. I could not auto update my plugins. After some research, I found that it was a problem with the hosting server having php4 and php5 enabled at the same time. This is common practice for shared hosting plans.  I found that adding the following lines to the .htaccess file will fix the problem.  
  <blockquote>AddType x-mapp-php5 .php  
AddHandler x-mapp-php5 .php</blockquote>  
Before doing this, I would recommend you backup your Wordpress installation (incl. database, files and folders).",
