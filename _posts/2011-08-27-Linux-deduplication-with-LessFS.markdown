title: Linux deduplication with LessFS

De-duplication is a type of compression that looks for redundant data and instead of duplicating data it will create a reference that points to the original source. For example, if you have two images that are exactly the same but one is in your Pictures folder and you copy it to your desktop. Instead of having an exact copy of the image, a "link" is created that points back to the original. If the original image in your Pictures folder is deleted, de-duplication will determine that this resource is still in use and the "link" will remain intact.  

Deduplication uses hashes to compare data. Even if filenames and extensions are different, deduplication will see these files as the same. One drawback to this could be that if two completely different files generate the same hash. This is considered a "collision" and even though there is a very small chance this could occur, it is possible.  

In this tutorial I will set up LessFS on a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server to handle my deduplication. This is pretty straight forward and very easy to set up.  

We will start with a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. We will not need anything to be installed during the OS install, unless you want an SSH server to finish the install remotely.  

Once you boot into the server the first time we will do our updates and install the needed packages.  
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade && sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libmhash-dev libtokyocabinet-dev pkg-config libfuse-dev  


Now download LessFS from sourceforge  
wget <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lessfs/files/lessfs/lessfs-1.5.0/lessfs-1.5.0.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/lessfs/files/lessfs/lessfs-1.5.0/lessfs-1.5.0.tar.gz</a>  


untar the files using  
tar -xzvf lessfs-1.5.0.tar.gz  


Change to the new directory  
cd lessfs-1.5.0  


Configure the LessFS package  
./configure  


Build LessFS  
make  


Install LessFS  
make install  


Copy the example startup script  
sudo cp etc/lessfs-init_example /etc/init.d/lessfs.sh  


Open the new startup script using your favorite text editor  
sudo nano /etc/init.d/lessfs.sh  


Now the hardest part of this tutorial, edit the file as follows  

EDIT line 10 . /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions to #. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions  
EDIT line 15 . /etc/sysconfig/network to #. /etc/sysconfig/network  
EDIT line 18 [ ${NETWORKING} = "no" ] && exit 0 to #[ ${NETWORKING} = "no" ] && exit 0  
ADD line 19 [ -f /var/run/network/ifstate ] && [ $(cat /var/run/network/ifstate | wc -l ) -eq 0 ] && exit 0  
EDIT line 22 MKLESSFS=/usr/local/sbin/mklessfs  
EDIT line 23 MOUNTPOINT=/fuse to MOUNTPOINT=**/<span>path</span>/<span>to</span>/<span>mount</span>**  
EDIT line 25 LESSFS=/usr/local/bin/lessfs  
EDIT line 39 touch /var/lock/subsys/lessfs to touch /var/lock/lessfs  
EDIT line 49 rm -f /var/lock/subsys/lessfs to rm -f /var/lock/lessfs  

Make the startup script executable  
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/lessfs.sh  


Set this script to run when the system boots  
sudo update-rc.d lessfs.sh defaults  


Copy the LessFS configuration file  
sudo cp etc/lessfs.cfg /etc/  


Edit /etc/lessfs.cfg, if you would like to change the data directory (default: /data)  
sudo nano /etc/lessfs.cfg  


Make the LessFS directories for storing the file information and metadata  
sudo mkdir /data_directory && sudo mkdir /data_directory/dta && sudo mkdir /data_directory/mta  


Create the LessFS files  
sudo mklessfs -c /etc/lessfs.cfg  


Now you can reboot. This will give us an opportunity to test out startup script. Once the server has rebooted and you are logged in, run the command  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


If this command displays a filesystem, then you are ready to go.  

**NOTE:** If you decide not the use a startup script, you can mount the filesystem manually using  
sudo lessfs /etc/lessfs.cfg /path/to/mount  


Now after all that we can test it out. One of the best examples I have found for testing LessFS out is to use dd and /dev/zero. For this example, my data directory is /mnt.  

Check your LessFS file system usage using  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


Using the command below will create a 1GB file in /mnt.  
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test.dump bs=1M count=1000  


Check you LessFS file system usage again  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


Notice that usage is not a 1GB difference. Using dd with /dev/zero created a 1GB file using nothing but zeros. LessFS recognized that the file was made up of a duplication of information and so it was able to highly compress the file.  

Try it again, except this time create a file in the root of the drive.  
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/test.dump bs=1M count=1000  


Check your space available  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


Delete the test.dump file  
sudo rm test.dump  


Check your space again  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


Now create the same file, but under your data directory  
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test.dump bs=1M count=1000  


Check your usage  
df -t fuse.lessfs  


You should see a huge difference in the space used.  

That is all. It seems like a lot when reading this, but the longest part of this whole thing is installing the server OS and updating. Installing and configuring LessFS is a breeze. According to the <a href="http://lessfs.com" target="blank">official site</a> LessFS also works fine with Samba.  

If you have any feedback or ways to make this better, leave them in comments.
