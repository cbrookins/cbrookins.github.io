I was playing around with a Linux distro (Backtrack 4) on my netbook and accidently overwrote the Windows boot loader with the GRUB boot loader. My workstation would not boot anymore but I knew everything was still in place. All I had to do was restore the Windows boot loader.  

To do this, you will need the installation media for Windows. In my case, it was upgrade media that I downloaded and created a bootable USB drive with.  

Once you boot to the installation media, choose "Repair your computer" from the second screen.  

Then choose the installation you want to repair from the list and select "Next". Most users will only have one choice.  

From the next menu select "Command Prompt"  

Then enter the command:  
  <blockquote>bootrec /fixmbr</blockquote>  
Now you can reboot your workstation and Windows should boot up with no problem.  

***Note:** I found that some users needed to also run the command:*  
<blockquote>*bootrec /FixBoot*</blockquote>  
*I did not need to run this command to fix my workstation, but depending on the situation, you may need to.*",
