title: SFTP Server with chroot
date: 2021-04-08

## Scenario
I needed a SFTP server with a few different users who could upload, but not be able to see what the others uploaded.  The default installation allows users to
move around the filesystem and view most files.  This was my setup using CentOS 8.

## Setup  

### Create a group
```addgroup sftp```

### Create a user
```
adduser -G sftp -s /bin/false *username*
passwd *username*
```

### Set up folder structure for chroot
```
mkdir -p /home/jail  
chown root:root /home/jail   
chmod 755 /home/jail  
```

### Make directory for user
```
mkdir -p /home/jail/*username*  
chown *usernamer*:*username* /home/jail/*username*  
chmod 700 /home/jail/*username*
```

### Modify sshd_config
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
```
  
AllowTTY and AllowX11Forwarding defaults are already **no**, but I like to make sure by uncommenting the line.  
change **#AllowTTY no** to **AllowTTY no**  
change **#AllowX11Forwarding no** to **AllowX11Forwarding no**  

add the line **AllowGroups sftp**  
add the following  
```
Match Group sftp
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory /home/jail
``` 
  
Restart SSH  
```service sshd restart```
